# BattleTankGame2
An open-world tank battling game. Simple AI, terrain and advanced control system.

## Concept
On a low poly terrain, 2 tanks are spawned, either side of the map. The tanks must fight it out against each other, until one tank remains standing. There is also a mortar on the map that is trying to kill the player. The terrain can be used for tactical advantage, such as using the unevenness in the land as cover from enemy fire.

## Rules
Both players start with finite health and ammo, and each direct hit (a fire that made contact to the opponent) takes a away health from the opponent.
How to win: The player must defeat the enemy tank and the mortar.
How to lose: The player must be killed by either the opposing tank or the mortar.

### What you are allowed to do
* Drive around the map as much as you like. The player has infinite fuel.
* Spend as much time as you like to kill the enemies. The battle is not timed.

### What you are not allowed to do
* Leave the map. The map is surrounded by mountains far too steep for the player to climb.
* the player cannot come back to life after dying. they must restart the game if they are killed.

## Requirements
### Sound Effects
* Tanks firing, driving, the tank's engine running, barrel moving, mortar sounds, and explosions.
* Music to be played in the menu, and in the game, to create suspense.

### Art
* Background-image for the menu.
* Texture for the terrain.
* Textures for the tanks and the mortar.
* <i>(possibly a sprite image for the firing of the bullet)</i>
